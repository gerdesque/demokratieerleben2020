The scrollytelling project **"Demokratie erLeben" (Living Democracy)** was developed as a prototype  
within the cultural hackathon 'Coding da Vinci Westfalen-Ruhrgebiet' between October and December 2019.  

The narrative as well as the stop-motion videos were created based on (and under usage of) photos, sources and  
materials from the Archive of the Workers' Youth Movement.  

In 2020, as part of a 3-months-grant from Coding da Vinci,  
the project was completely renewed, expanded, and optimized for the purposes of the archive.
