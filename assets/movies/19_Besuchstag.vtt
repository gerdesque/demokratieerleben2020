During the camp, which lasts several weeks,
 there are so-called visiting days.

00:05.085 --> 00:08.250
On these days, 
 the Children's Republic is open to the public

00:08.500 --> 00:12.500
and offers interested people and the 
 children's families the opportunity

00:12.550 --> 00:16.100
to see the work of the Friends of the Childrens 
 with their own eyes.

00:16.200 --> 00:22.583
Among the visitors are often comrades from the region,
 but also representatives of the churches.
