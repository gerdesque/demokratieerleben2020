00:00.100 --> 00:02.583
Ten to twenty tents form a tent village.

00:02.750 --> 00:08.083
The tent chairwomen and chairmen of these tents 
 are thus the tent village council,

00:08.250 --> 00:12.250
at the head of which an adult helper 
 is appointed as mayor.

00:12.750 --> 00:16.917
The tent village council discusses 
 all matters of the village:

00:17.000 --> 00:20.417
Hikes, competitions, guard duties and so on.

00:20.917 --> 00:26.083
From each of these tent village councils,
 two children are elected to the camp parliament.

00:26.150 --> 00:31.917
And the camp parliament decides on those things
 that affect the whole Children's Republic.
