Gerda is particularly impressed by the 
 thoughtful location and organisation of the camp.

00:05.700 --> 00:10.100
There is a small stream nearby for 
 fetching water and washing,

00:10.500 --> 00:16.500
there is a village square in the middle of the camp
 and even self-built latrines in the forest.

00:16.700 --> 00:20.700
All children are instructed 
 in the use of the latrines at the beginning,

00:20.750 --> 00:24.300
so that there are no mishaps and no stench 
 near the tents later on.
