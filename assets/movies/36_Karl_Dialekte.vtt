There are children from all parts of the Weimar Republic
 in the tent camp.

00:03.750 --> 00:06.950
Some speak strange dialects 
 that Karl barely understands.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.250
If something goes too slowly for the Baden children,
 they say "Numme net huddle!",

00:12.300 --> 00:15.500
even though Karl still doesn't know 
 exactly what that means.

00:15.550 --> 00:19.300
Sometimes the children from the north
 accuse him of 'KlÃ¶nschnack'

00:19.350 --> 00:23.100
when it's his turn to do kitchen duty and 
 he shouldn't talk so much on the side.
