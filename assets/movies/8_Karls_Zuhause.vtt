Karl is living with his family in a 
 small Upper Lusatian House,

00:04.125 --> 00:07.125
which his family has been living 
 in for one hundred years.

00:07.875 --> 00:11.375
At that time, the weaving families 
 mostly produced at home.

00:11.625 --> 00:16.625
Today, most of them work in textile factories 
 and weaving mills, just like Karl's parents.

00:17.125 --> 00:22.000
Their house squeezes in tightly with 
 other small weavers' houses along the village street.

00:22.375 --> 00:27.375
At least the narrow garden is big enough 
 for two pigs and ten chickens.
