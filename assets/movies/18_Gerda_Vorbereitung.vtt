There is a lot to prepare for the Children's Republic.

00:03.400 --> 00:09.500
Even though the children's group shares
 responsibility and commitment for the arising tasks,

00:09.550 --> 00:13.300
here are still some things that the helpers
 have to pay attention to.

00:14.100 --> 00:20.000
Gerda has to make sure that all the children
 have a medical check-up before they leave

00:20.050 --> 00:22.300
and that they are suitable for a tent camp.

00:22.700 --> 00:27.700
In addition, the helpers check the cash register 
 administered by the children

00:27.900 --> 00:29.700
to ensure that everything is in order.
