The food at the camp is much more varied
 than the food at Karl's home.

00:04.950 --> 00:06.700
Sometimes there is even meat.

00:06.750 --> 00:09.500
Karl's favourite food so far is rice pudding.

00:09.550 --> 00:12.900
He has never eaten that before, 
 because rice is very expensive 

00:12.950 --> 00:17.700
and at home they usually have potatoes.
