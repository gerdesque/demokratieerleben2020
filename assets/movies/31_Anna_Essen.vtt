The food at the camp is better than what
 many children here are used to at home.

00:04.950 --> 00:06.700
Sometimes there is even meat.

00:06.900 --> 00:11.100
Anna's favourite meal so far is 
 green beans with mutton and potatoes.

00:11.200 --> 00:13.200
She has never eaten that before.

00:13.300 --> 00:17.100
And chocolate is very rare at home, even at Christmas.

00:17.200 --> 00:21.900
But here, sometimes there is even some chocolate 
 for everyone for breakfast!
