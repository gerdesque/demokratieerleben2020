Anna has volunteered to work in the camp library.

00:03.300 --> 00:07.700
Most of the children here don't have own books,
 as they are too expensive.

00:08.300 --> 00:12.700
In the camp library there are exciting books with funny stories,

00:13.000 --> 00:17.700
but also political ones, where the children can learn
 something about the working class.

00:18.100 --> 00:23.500
Anna's job is to give out the books 
 and take them back again.
