00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Anna likes to talk to her grandfather

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
when she has some time besides all her duties.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
One evening she sat down with him
 on the bench around the stove

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
and asked him for advice about her future.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
The grandfather then told her about her grandmother

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
who had died in a factory accident many years ago.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
He put his hand on Anna's shoulder and said:

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
'I wish that later on you wouldn't have to work
 in such a dirty and noisy factory.'
