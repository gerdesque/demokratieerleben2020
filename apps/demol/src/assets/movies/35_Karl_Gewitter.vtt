00:00.100 --> 00:03.300
Suddenly it starts to rain and storm terribly.

00:03.350 --> 00:04.900
There is lightning and thunder.

00:04.950 --> 00:06.900
Then hailstones fall.

00:06.950 --> 00:08.900
Some of the tents are destroyed.

00:09.100 --> 00:13.700
Karl tries in vain to keep his 
 group's tent from flying away.

00:13.750 --> 00:15.900
After a few hours, the storm is over,

00:16.000 --> 00:19.700
but now the whole Children's Republic 
 is faced with a big task:

00:19.750 --> 00:22.100
rebuilding the tent camp.
