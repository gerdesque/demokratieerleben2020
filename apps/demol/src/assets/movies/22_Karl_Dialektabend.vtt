Karl has noticed that many children in the tent camp
 know nothing about Silesia

00:04.950 --> 00:07.100
and understand his dialect poorly.

00:08.000 --> 00:13.900
Together with other Silesian children he has therefore 
 organised a dialect evening for his tent village .

00:14.100 --> 00:19.500
First they perform excerpts from Gerhart Hauptmann's drama
 'The Weavers' as a chorus.

00:19.600 --> 00:22.300
Then they discuss with the other children 

00:22.350 --> 00:26.500
the current situation of workers in 
 the industrial weaving mills of Silesia.
