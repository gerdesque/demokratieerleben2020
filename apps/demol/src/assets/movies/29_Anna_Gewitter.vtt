00:00.000 --> 00:03.300
Suddenly it starts to rain and storm terribly.

00:03.350 --> 00:05.000
There is lightning and thunder.

00:05.050 --> 00:06.900
Then hailstones fall.

00:06.950 --> 00:09.350
Some of the tents are destroyed.

00:09.400 --> 00:13.100
Anna tries to seek shelter in one 
 of the remaining large tents.

00:13.500 --> 00:15.700
After a few hours, 
the storm is over,

00:15.900 --> 00:19.500
but now the whole Children's Republic 
 is faced with a big task:

00:19.550 --> 00:21.300
rebuilding the tent camp.
