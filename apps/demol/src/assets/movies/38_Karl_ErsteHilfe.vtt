00:00.100 --> 00:03.000
Karl takes part in a first aid workshop.

00:03.100 --> 00:07.300
There he learns what to do if someone has had 
 an accident or is injured.

00:07.400 --> 00:11.100
Karl thinks that this knowledge 
 could be useful for him later

00:11.150 --> 00:14.700
when he will be a worker in a factory or in the mine.
