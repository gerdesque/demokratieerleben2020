Shortly afterwards we went to the washing. After washing we had breakfast. Then we repaired our tent. Between 12 o'clock and 1 pm was the Falcon's general assembly. The new camp leader had different topics to negotiate, for example: the visiting day. We had a children's day and the helpers had nothing to say. They had to go on a hike instead. At 1.30 pm we got lunch. There were boiled potatoes with a rollmop. After lunch we had free time. At 3.30 pm we had a snack. After the snack time there was a circus. At 7 pm we had dinner. After that there was a folk dance. All of a sudden a noise had started in the street. The helpers came back from the hike. They were not supposed to get to the camp before 12 o'clock. Hermann Neddermeyer announced camp silence, but there were protests. Hermann told about his escape from England. Soon there was the camp rest. As soon as we were in the tents, the helper’s alarm sounded.\nFriendship.\nIrma"

After a while we got up, because it had blown to get out of bed. We quickly shook out our blankets. Then we went to wash ourselves. After coffee we stayed in the tent again, because it was raining. Heinz told us that we should 'pack our monkeys', because it could be that we would move into the emergency quarters today. Our camp president has already gone to town and asks if we could use some school as emergency quarters. So we packed our bags in the morning to be ready to leave and soon we had lunch. The weather was already getting better. In the evening there was a meeting for helpers. There, everything was discussed. It turned out that we were not going to move away today. But, if it continues to rain, we will move to the emergency quarters. In the evening we played in a circle. After the night's rest we soon fell asleep.\nFriendship.\nGeorg"

At 10.30 am we practised a movement choir with Willi. Then we had lunch. There were potatoes, mustard sauce and two eggs. After lunch we wanted to go hiking, but we had to vote first, because some did not want to join us. Finally, we started walking. We walked to the observation tower and picked blueberries. When it started to rain, we went back to the camp. We arrived late. Night's rest was at 9 pm.\nFriendship.\nLotte"
